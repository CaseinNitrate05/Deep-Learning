## ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Classification with TensorFlow

This project uses **TensorFlow** to build a deep learning model that can recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the **MNIST dataset**. It is created in a **Jupyter Notebook** using **Python**, and shows how to train, test, and visualize a digit classification model.

### âœ… What the Project Does

* Loads the **MNIST dataset** (images of handwritten digits)
* Builds a **neural network** using TensorFlow and Keras
* Trains the model to recognize digits
* Tests the modelâ€™s accuracy on new images
* Shows predictions and highlights correct/incorrect results

### ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning)
* NumPy, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

### ðŸ“Š What Youâ€™ll Learn

* How to use TensorFlow for image classification
* How to work with the MNIST dataset
* How neural networks learn to recognize patterns
* How to show model performance using plots and predictions
